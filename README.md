- On some loans, investors earned -0.010%. This means that as an investor, one could end up with losses. 
- The higher an individual's income, the higher the loan amount that can be possibly accessed.

- High risk rated(1.0) individuals were given significantly lower loan amounts compared to higher scored individuals.
- The 36 month loan duration is prefered by individuals across all income ranges.
- The loans of individuals with prosper rating 6 and 7 are the best for loan investment opportunities.
- For both upper and lower credit score, owning a home and having a high credit score range was associated with a better lender yield, compared to individuals who do not own homes and have a lower credit range score.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, i will focus on the lender yield and its relationship with other metrics such as credit score, prosper rating, income level and employment status. The lender yield as a single metric may not inform an investor about the best prosper loan to invest in. Combining the lender yield with other known characteristics will help an investor make better choices on what loan to invest in and help the prosper company fund low risk loans.
Prosper Company generates more gains than losses for its investors, making it a viable income source. Its previously generated output will prove this true.
